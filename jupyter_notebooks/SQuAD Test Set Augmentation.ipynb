We hung it up with 6 BIG 4\\\" wall toggle bolts. On the top shelf I house an external WD Hdd, a WDTV Live and a Actiontec HDMI WiFi Transmitter. On the second shelf I have my Dish Network 722 (fits perfectly even with all the wires coming out the back). On the bottom shelf I have an old Ken wood Stereo Receive (fits, but the front legs come off just a bit but this doesn't affect stability. The receiver measures 17\\\"w x 14\\\"d x 5\\\"h.The wire maintenance was a little trick. We used a wire coat hanger and some masking tape to thread the bulky wires through the back.This unit installed is an amazing addition to your small living space, I highly recommend it!\",\n",

I used my simple SONY HTIB.The product is stong on the bottom so it's not going to tilt over. The extension part is a bit weak. I have it fully extended as I guess most people would like them. The product because to lose strength and stand a bit off centered. It leans to a side. I wouldn't return them! Just keep in mind that they are a great value and look great. Just has a clumsy feel to it. I tighten them every week when i see them leaning too much.\",\n",

Not only does is not have much suction power, you can't keep the battery plugged in so it is always charged and ready to go. If you don't use it for 4-5 days, the charge depletes! So then you have to recharge it for 14-16 hours. Not convenient at all. So I returned the dustbuster. I then ordered a Eureka that works great and can be left plugged in, permanently. The model number is H96. It is not as large as it looks in the photos and is a great buy; not to mention it costs less than the inefficient new dustbusters. The new dustbuster models are now just cheap knock offs of the original great machines. Black and Decker in their attempt to make a higher profit by cheapening a previously great product, destroyed a really good thing.I strongly recommend the Eureka below:Eureka Quick Up Cordless 2 in 1, 96Hproduct.\",\n",
