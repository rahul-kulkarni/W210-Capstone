First the portability. Yes, the item in question weighs roughly 100 lbs, but the portability doesn't have to do with the weight, but rather the ability to have it anywhere in your house or apartment rather than shoved in a window. The portable in the title doesn't imply lightweight to some, so I'm making the clarification here.The portable unit covers about 550 square feet, which is wonderful if you have a small apartment, loft or studio. It's also wonderful to have if you live in an apartment complex where AC is only on from say, May to August and you experience a heat wave or you live in the South where it's still warm long after Summer ends. In any of these cases this A/C unit will be a godsend. This would also be great on a screened in porch.Now even though you don't need to put the unit in a window, you do need to use one for the Window, which again limits the actual portability for the unit. The length of the exhaust kit is not very long and there's no real way to lengthen it, so keep that in mind when considering to purchase this.Now I have to again state that the A/C unit works wonderfully. it gets the room or area un question quite cool and it does so quickly.

In my review I make a lot of comments abut the 15 degree angle of sharpness vs. the 20 degree. Now I am forced to reveal that I can't tell the difference. The Henckle's feels just as sharp and easily passes the paper test. I guess I was comparing my new Wusthof to used 20 degree class knives, although they had been sharpened. I still like the Wusthof but the new Hencjke's is just as good and the handle is excellent. Froom the picture I assumed the handle was the old style flat handle but this one is much bigger, fatter, and fits my hand just as well. Like I concluded, the best way to buy a knife is to go somewhere like ----- where you can feel what;s best for you and then buy it on amazon.When the Asian knives came out with their 15 degrees of sharpness, I bought at least a dozen, mostly Shun and some Myobi. But now here comes Wusthof with 14 degrees of sharpness ( you can't tell the difference with a bigger handle an thicker blade (from the top). The result is a more comfortable heavier knife like I am use to using. I still love my shun knives but not quite as much as this. My all time favorite is the Shun Ken Onion chefs knives but shun and ken onion have apparently parted company. The ken onion knives are just called ken onion and are made by a different company. The handles are shorter, too short for me with my XL hands. They are just not as comfortable and not as heavy as the shun ken onion. You can still get them but I don't know for how long. For me these new Wusthof Ikon classic knives will do just fine. I don't understand the 2 star comment. The handle is solid and comfortable. Put next to a Shun they are just as sharp, heavier and feel more solid. I wish I had not spent so much on the Asian knives so I could afford a few more of these. I probably will buy a few anyway and I do like m shun knives, just not as much as these.

You really cant beat it for the price, and even with cost aside, it is a great knife to have in your arsenal", "5dd4cb66cc027a086d65fb57": "turns out to be one of my favorites", "5dd4cb9acc027a086d65fb6c": "thickness or moisture content", "5dd4cb9acc027a086d65fb6d": "toast, bagels, and English muffins", "5dd4cb9acc027a086d65fb6e": "toasting than Cuisinart's more expensive model", "5dd4cb9acc027a086d65fb6f": "chrome", "5dd4cae1cc027a086d65fb14": "light", "5dd4cae1cc027a086d65fb15": "shattering a car window", "5dd4cae1cc027a086d65fb17": "a few years", "5dd4cae1cc027a086d65fb18": "to watch the cord come home", "5dd4cae1cc027a086d65fb16": "swivel", "5dd4cb58cc027a086d65fb40": "20 years old", "5dd4cb58cc027a086d65fb42": "I love the Pyrex", "5dd4cb58cc027a086d65fb44": "up 2 cups of anything", "5dd4cb58cc027a086d65fb43": "the clear glass", "5dd4cb58cc027a086d65fb41": "it's about 20 years old", "5dd4cbc7cc027a086d65fb74": "my Le Parfait jars", "5dd4cbc7cc027a086d65fb75": "15 years", "5dd4cbc7cc027a086d65fb76": "those pantry moths no matter", "5dd4cbc7cc027a086d65fb77": "free shipping", "5dd4cbc7cc027a086d65fb78": "flour and sugar", "5dd4cc70cc027a086d65fb93": "cork or plastics", "5dd4cc70cc027a086d65fb94": "OXO Good Grips tools and gadgets", "5dd4cc70cc027a086d65fb96": "the ability to clean the OXO trivets properly is very nice", "5dd4cc70cc027a086d65fb92": "OXO", "5dd4cc70cc027a086d65fb95": "the ability to clean the OXO trivets properly is very nice", "5dd4cd06cc027a086d65fbca": "June", "5dd4cd06cc027a086d65fbcb": "a LOT of coffee", "5dd4cd06cc027a086d65fbcc": "wasted a lot of coffee and drank a lot of bitter brews", "5dd4cd06cc027a086d65fbce": "added water", "5dd4cd06cc027a086d65fbcd": "flawlessly", "5dd4cc55cc027a086d65fb88": "a salt crock", "5dd4cc55cc027a086d65fb89": "I ordered one of these covered casseroles to use as a salt crock", "5dd4cc55cc027a086d65fb8b": "China", "5dd4cc55cc027a086d65fb8c": "Alton Brown", "5dd4cc55cc027a086d65fb8a": "on my counter", "5dd4cf01cc027a086d65fc56": "Iron Lady", "5dd4cf01cc027a086d65fc57": "over 40 years", "5dd4cf01cc027a086d65fc58": "porcelain", "5dd4cf01cc027a086d65fc5a": "Margaret Thatcher", "5dd4cf01cc027a086d65fc59": "Yes, these are porcelain", "5dd4d14bcc027a086d65fcf4": "stroke stick", "5dd4d14bcc027a086d65fcf5": "You can get into a fast rhythm", "5dd4d14bcc027a086d65fcf6": "slightly", "5dd4d14bcc027a086d65fcf7": "longer strokes", "5dd4d14bcc027a086d65fcf8": "julienne tool", "5dd4d28ccc027a086d65fd2e": "a jeweler", "5dd4d28ccc027a086d65fd2f": "what the gem SHOULD weigh if it were a diamond perfectly cut", "5dd4d28ccc027a086d65fd30": "diameter and depth", "5dd4d28ccc027a086d65fd31": "real diamond or a synthetic", "5dd4d28ccc027a086d65fd32": "3.4 carats", "5dd4d5e8cc027a086d65fd8a": "hose", "5dd4d5e8cc027a086d65fd8b": "red is awesome and matches nicely with other bright red", "5dd4d5e8cc027a086d65fd8c": "i.e", "5dd4d5e8cc027a086d65fd8d": "dish soap", "5dd4d5e8cc027a086d65fd8e": "it sat too far back to drain properly into the sink", "5dd4ccdbcc027a086d65fbb6": "13x9", "5dd4ccdbcc027a086d65fbb7": "top quality product and i'm glad i bought it", "5dd4ccdbcc027a086d65fbba": "haven't had any problems cleaning it and i haven't", "5dd4ccdbcc027a086d65fbb9": "13x9 glass", "5dd4ccdbcc027a086d65fbb8": "it is a top quality product and i'm glad i bought it", "5dd4e20dcc027a086d65ff1c": "13x9", "5dd4e20dcc027a086d65ff1d": "white", "5dd4e20dcc027a086d65ff1f": "food sticking", "5dd4e20dcc027a086d65ff20": "love it for enchiladas, roasting meat, chicken and/or vegetables", "5dd4e20dcc027a086d65ff1e": "white porcelain pan, i love the handles and the fact that it can be used for more than lasagna", "5dd4ce11cc027a086d65fbf6": "anything I \"threw\"", "5dd4ce11cc027a086d65fbf7": "I have not owned a juicer", "5dd4ce11cc027a086d65fbf8": "anything I \"threw\"", "5dd4ce11cc027a086d65fbf9": "the container doubles as a pitcher", "5dd4ce11cc027a086d65fbfa": "Overall I like it very much", "5dd4e4a5cc027a086d65ff9d": "It juiced anything I \"threw\" at it, though as someone mentioned it occasionally gets to the point where the pulp builds up in the strainer, and it has to be cleaned out, especially with larger citrus.

No lumpy pieces of fruit or bits of ice hiding in the drink. It also does a good job of pulling the ingredients down the side of the jar and around the blades so that everything gets blended properly.Now, the bad: Shortly after my 1-year warranty expired, I turned on my blender one day and it abruptly turned off after about one second. I actually think this was my fault as I didn't have the jar seated quite right and I had some ice cubes at the bottom of the jar right by the blades. At any rate, to make a long story short I was left with the option to either (a) pay to get the blender repaired, which would have cost over half what one costs new; (b) throw the blender away; or (c) try to fix the thing myself. I had a hunch that perhaps I could find a fuse inside that had blown, so I attempted to take apart the blender. I tried A LOT of different screwdrivers, both at home and at work, and I could not get any of them to grip the screws properly to remove them. I took the blender to my local hardware store and, after a lot of patience, was finally able to remove the screws. While I readily found a fuse, the hardware store said they didn't have a matching replacement fuse. A little frustrated but still determined, I went to yet another hardware store; a seemingly knowledgeable clerk there told me that I would probably have a hard time finding the proper fuse because of the filament design, even though the fuse is labeled as a 5 amp 125 volt fuse. Still determined, I went to Radio Shack. Though they did not have a fuse that looked the same in terms of filament, the guy there assured me that a slow blowing 5 amp 250 volt fuse should work just fine. And guess what -- he was right. So now I have an additional three back up fuses in case it blows again, for a total out of pocket cost of less than 10%", "5dd4ce8bcc027a086d65fc1f": "black version", "5dd4ce8bcc027a086d65fc1d": "Oster 6646", "5dd4ceebcc027a086d65fc24": "real brewer", "5dd4ceebcc027a086d65fc25": "2 months", "5dd4ceebcc027a086d65fc26": "real coffee", "5dd4ceebcc027a086d65fc27": "at the jobsite", "5dd4ceebcc027a086d65fc28": "watered-down", "5dd4ceefcc027a086d65fc2e": "rabbits", "5dd4ceefcc027a086d65fc2f": "spare ribs", "5dd4ceefcc027a086d65fc31": "carbon", "5dd4ceefcc027a086d65fc32": "carbon", "5dd4ceefcc027a086d65fc30": "heavy", "5dd4cef2cc027a086d65fc38": "pepper and salt shaker", "5dd4cef2cc027a086d65fc3b": "the pepper compartment was tiny", "5dd4cef2cc027a086d65fc39": "crate and barrel", "5dd4cef2cc027a086d65fc3a": "Dansk", "5dd4cef2cc027a086d65fc3c": "few months", "5dd4cef4cc027a086d65fc42": "10", "5dd4cef4cc027a086d65fc44": "magnetic strips", "5dd4cef4cc027a086d65fc43": "the side of an upper cabinet in the kitchen", "5dd4cef4cc027a086d65fc45": "Henckels chef's knives with no problem.

It's not really non-stick because the eggs won't easily slide off the pan like they would from a good new non-stick pan, but it's much much better compared w/ my stainless steel skillets. As long as you soak the pan in water after cooking, by the time you finish your meal, the food residue can be easily washed off with a brush or sponge. I use a nylon dish brush with hot water and cleaning is very fast and easy. I never use soap or steel wool. Leaving a bit grease on acts like re-seasoning. This is the same way I take care of my carbon-steel wok. The only complaint I have is that the handle is way too short. The skillet is relatively heavy but even with my small hands it still feels as if the handle only fits half of my palm, so it forces your hand to hold it really close to the hot pan - really bad design.
