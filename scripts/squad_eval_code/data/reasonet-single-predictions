I even melted chocolate and marshmallow for some cookies in the saucepans and those also cleaned up quite easily.Now for a couple things that could be better:*The set could have included a lid for the smaller fry pan. I assumed that the lid to the one of the saucepans would fit the smaller fry pan as well (my old set was this way) and was slightly disappointed to find that this is not the case.*One of the saucepans has some \"pitting\" on the inside bottom that was not there when I opened the box.

No lumpy pieces of fruit or bits of ice hiding in the drink. It also does a good job of pulling the ingredients down the side of the jar and around the blades so that everything gets blended properly.Now, the bad: Shortly after my 1-year warranty expired, I turned on my blender one day and it abruptly turned off after about one second. I actually think this was my fault as I didn't have the jar seated quite right and I had some ice cubes at the bottom of the jar right by the blades. At any rate, to make a long story short I was left with the option to either (a) pay to get the blender repaired, which would have cost over half what one costs new; (b) throw the blender away; or (c) try to fix the thing myself. I had a hunch that perhaps I could find a fuse inside that had blown, so I attempted to take apart the blender. I tried A LOT of different screwdrivers, both at home and at work, and I could not get any of them to grip the screws properly to remove them. I took the blender to my local hardware store and, after a lot of patience, was finally able to remove the screws. While I readily found a fuse, the hardware store said they didn't have a matching replacement fuse. A little frustrated but still determined, I went to yet another hardware store; a seemingly knowledgeable clerk there told me that I would probably have a hard time finding the proper fuse because of the filament design, even though the fuse is labeled as a 5 amp 125 volt fuse. Still determined, I went to Radio Shack. Though they did not have a fuse that looked the same in terms of filament, the guy there assured me that a slow blowing 5 amp 250 volt fuse should work just fine. And guess what -- he was right. So now I have an additional three back up fuses in case it blows again, for a total out of pocket cost of less than 10%", "5dd4ce8bcc027a086d65fc1f": "black", "5dd4ce8bcc027a086d65fc1d": "6646.First", "5dd4ceebcc027a086d65fc24": "K Cup Brewer", "5dd4ceebcc027a086d65fc25": "2 months", "5dd4ceebcc027a086d65fc26": "K Cup Brewer", "5dd4ceebcc027a086d65fc27": "at the jobsite", "5dd4ceebcc027a086d65fc28": "watered-down", "5dd4ceefcc027a086d65fc2e": "rabbits", "5dd4ceefcc027a086d65fc2f": "adobo", "5dd4ceefcc027a086d65fc31": "carbon", "5dd4ceefcc027a086d65fc32": "carbon", "5dd4ceefcc027a086d65fc30": "heavy", "5dd4cef2cc027a086d65fc38": "pepper and salt shaker", "5dd4cef2cc027a086d65fc3b": "the pepper compartment was tiny, so returned that.Very pleased with the operation of this one", "5dd4cef2cc027a086d65fc39": "crate and barrel", "5dd4cef2cc027a086d65fc3a": "Dansk", "5dd4cef2cc027a086d65fc3c": "few months", "5dd4cef4cc027a086d65fc42": "10", "5dd4cef4cc027a086d65fc44": "magnetic strips", "5dd4cef4cc027a086d65fc43": "Amazon", "5dd4cef4cc027a086d65fc45": "Henckels", "5dd4cef4cc027a086d65fc46": "slicer and boning knives", "5dd4cef7cc027a086d65fc4c": "more positive, I really do", "5dd4cef7cc027a086d65fc50": "fastening system", "5dd4cef7cc027a086d65fc4e": "a new leather sectional", "5dd4cef7cc027a086d65fc4f": "to mostly prevent the dogs from scratching the leather", "5dd4cef7cc027a086d65fc4d": "four", "5dd4cf2fcc027a086d65fc72": "nicel little scrubber", "5dd4cf2fcc027a086d65fc74": "nicel little scrubber.
